1. The Au sensor data consists of impedance, frequency, and time obtained through bare electrodes sensors, along with the properties data of the synthesized aerogels collected during Au sensor data collection.
   The Pd sensor data consists of impedance, frequency, and time obtained through Pd/Au electrodes sensors, along with the properties data of the synthesized aerogels collected during Pd/Au sensor data collection.


2. Using sensor data to predict silica aerogel properties with an MLP model for silica aerogel prediction.


3. Using impedance data to predict silica aerogel properties with MLP, small transformer, and LSTM models: performance comparison.
