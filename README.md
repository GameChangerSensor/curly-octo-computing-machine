-The Bare Au sensor data consists of impedance, frequency, and time data obtained through bare electrodes sensors during the aging process, along with the properties data of the final synthesized aerogels collected after the Au sensor data collection during the aging process.

-The Pd modified sensor data consists of impedance, frequency, and time data obtained through Pd/Au electrodes sensors during the aging process, along with the properties data of the final synthesized aerogels collected after the Pd/Au sensor data collection during the aging process.
